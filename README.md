# How to run the program
1) Open terminal in root folder
2) Type the following line in terminal
   "g++ -o main.o main.cpp"
   
#Progress made till now
1) Simulation of DiskFileManager created
2) Implementation of classes: Record, Page, Table, and DiskFileMgr
3) Indexfile, Pageinfo, Tableinfo files built and populated using appropriate functions
4) Linear Search for records on key value Implemented
5) Indexed search on key Implemented (Sparse Primary Indexing followed)
6) Organising main function for better UX
7) Addition, Deletion and Modification of records

#Things left to do
1) Testing current functions, especially for multiple tables as that has not been extensively tested
2) Apply time functions to measure performance improvements.
